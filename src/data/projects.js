			"The Birchwood Club began as a rational mid-century building in a Chicago suburb. It cultivated a sense of refinement without opulence. In the 7 decades that followed, a series of committees built relentlessly, and the heart of the building was encrusted over with additions, all by different architects, in several different styles. Less than half of the original building is now visible. We want to reveal the beautiful structure that lies underneath. Can we convince the club to reduce their square footage?",

			"The Chinatown Red Line stop is positioned at the periphery of the neighborhood, where visitors disembarking from the CTA are greeted by an expansive parking lot. This marketplace in Chicago's Chinatown acts as a conduit, connecting different neighborhoods and cultures to each other. Informed by the CTA and Chinatown's two major districts, the marketplace follows the natural axis of the site. Fibers of activity run along these powerful axes, connecting the new and the old. Against the grain of the fibers, smaller and more numerous east-to-west pathways create porosity between inside and outside. The market draws its energy and activity from the west and provides a quieter experience as one moves to the east. The lightness of the timber lamella structure contrasts with the heaviness of the steel and concrete infrastructure, suggesting the fluidity of the marketplace housed within.",

		narrative:
			"This conceptual 2-mile tower made entirely of wood required extensive study exploring how to push the material to its absolute limit. Designed as an inhabitable environmental repair machine, the tower's roots grow into a network that enables the repair of air and water to extend to faraway places. This root network also braces the structures, making them stronger, and enables the growth of new towers, transforming the repair process into an enjoyable experience. One could walk through a renewable bamboo forest high in the sky or climb through stacks of oxygen generators.",

			"Every summer, biology students at Knox college spend 10 weeks in the woods for a semester of outdoor learning. This sattelite campus is sited between a forest, a lake, and an undisturbed prarie preserve which is one of the world's most endangered habitats. The location means that students have the opportunity to study and enjoy several different midwestern ecosystems. However, the main multi-purpose building on site is an aging horse barn which is not able to cope with the increased size and curriculum of the outdoor learning program. The challenge in this project was to foster learning without disturbing the precious local habitat. Distinct spaces enable active learning throughout the day and restful solitude at night. The learning and dining areas are communal, while the bunk rooms were carefully arranged so that each student has their own window at the head of their bed. The building's sensitivity to the site included sustainable aspects such as robust insulation and air barrier, along with opportunities for natural light and ventilation.",

			"The restoration of this historic Chicago Park Fieldhouse in the Pulaski Park neighborhood involved structural, aesthetic, and accessibility improvements.  A structural micropile system was introduced to carefully reinforce a wing of the building that was sinking into the soil, and extensive masonry repairs were made to the brick facade.  Restoration also took place on the interior to match the existing tile and woodwork, while accessibility improvements included a new ramped entrance so that the entire community could enjoy the building and use it as a polling place on election days.",

			'A mixed-use high-rise design explores filtration as a core concept, examining how buildings filter people, light, views, wind, sound, and wildlife. Inspired by 2020 quarantine experiences and the "micro-commute" from bed to couch, the design splits the typical apartment building into distinct layers: active daytime spaces (work, exercise, parks) face the street as a buffer, while quiet residential areas are set back. The conventional double-loaded corridor is "peeled apart" - deep narrow residences on one side, amenities on the other, connected by bridges and open corridors, transforming circulation through the building into a meaningful spatial experience rather than just a means to an end.',
