			"The Birchwood Club began as a rational mid-century building. It cultivated a sense of refinement without opulence. In the 7 decades that followed, a series of committees built relentlessly, and the heart of the building was encrusted over with additions, all by different architects, in several different styles. Less than half of the original building is now visible. We want to reveal the beautiful structure that lies underneath. Can we convince the club to reduce their square footage?",

		narrative:
			"We aim to create a marketplace in Chicago’s Chinatown that acts as a conduit, connecting different neighborhoods and cultures to each other. Informed by the CTA and Chinatown’s two major districts, the marketplace follows the natural axis of the site. Fibers of activity run along these powerful axes, connecting the new and the old. Against the grain of the fibers, smaller and more numerous east-to-west pathways create porosity between inside and outside. The market draws its energy and activity from the west and provides a quieter experience as one moves to the east. The lightness of the timber lamella structure contrasts with the heaviness of the steel and concrete infrastructure, suggesting the fluidity of the marketplace housed within.",

			"Every summer, biology students at Knox college spend 10 weeks in the woods for a semester of outdoor learning. This sattelite campus is sited between a forest, a lake, and an undisturbed prarie preserve which is one of the world’s most endangered habitats. The location means that students have the opportunity to study and enjoy several different midwestern ecosystems. However, the main multi-purpose building on site is an aging horse barn which is not able to cope with the increased size and curriculum of the outdoor learning program.",

		narrative:
			'A mixed-use high-rise design explores filtration as a core concept, examining how buildings filter people, light, views, wind, sound, and wildlife. Inspired by 2020 quarantine experiences and the "micro-commute" from bed to couch, the design splits the typical apartment building into distinct layers: active daytime spaces (work, exercise, parks) face the street as a buffer, while quiet residential areas are set back. The conventional double-loaded corridor is "peeled apart" - deep narrow residences on one side, amenities on the other, connected by bridges and open corridors, transforming circulation through the building into a meaningful spatial experience rather than just a means to an end.',
